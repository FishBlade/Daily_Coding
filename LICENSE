​重要提示：此修改版在标准AGPLv3基础上增加了原始开发者权利保护和衍生版本开源要求。​​

序言
GNU Affero通用公共许可证是一个免费、著佐权（copyleft）的许可证，适用于软件和其他类型的作品，特别设计用于确保在网络服务器软件的情况下与社区合作。

大多数软件和其他实用作品的许可证旨在剥夺您分享和修改作品的自由。相比之下，我们的通用公共许可证旨在保障您分享和修改程序所有版本的自由——确保它对其所有用户保持自由软件。

当我们谈论自由软件时，我们指的是自由，而不是价格。我们的通用公共许可证旨在确保您拥有分发自由软件副本的自由（如果您愿意，可以收费），您可以接收源代码或者可以在需要时获取它，您可以修改软件或在新的自由程序中使用其部分内容，并且您知道您可以做这些事情。

使用我们通用公共许可证的开发人员通过两个步骤保护您的权利：（1）声明对软件的版权，（2）向您提供本许可证，授予您复制、分发和/或修改软件的合法许可。

保护所有用户自由的次要好处是，如果程序的替代版本中进行的改进得到广泛使用，其他开发人员可以将其纳入。许多自由软件的开发人员由此产生的合作感到振奋和鼓励。然而，对于在网络服务器上使用的软件，这一结果可能无法实现。GNU通用公共许可证允许制作修改版本并让公众在服务器上访问它，而无需向公众发布其源代码。

GNU Affero通用公共许可证专门设计用于确保在这种情况下，修改后的源代码对社区可用。它要求网络服务器的操作员向该服务器的用户提供在那里运行的修改版本的源代码。因此，在公开可访问的服务器上公开使用修改版本，使公众可以访问修改版本的源代码。

一个较旧的许可证，称为Affero通用公共许可证并由Affero发布，旨在实现类似目标。这是一个不同的许可证，不是Affero GPL的版本，但Affero已经发布了Affero GPL的新版本，允许根据本许可证重新许可。

以下为复制、分发和修改的精确条款和条件。

条款和条件
0. 定义
​​"本许可证"​​ 指GNU Affero通用公共许可证的第3版。

​​"版权"​​ 也指适用于其他类型作品的类似版权的法律，例如半导体掩模。

​​"程序"​​ 指根据本许可证许可的任何可版权作品。每个被许可人被称为 ​​"您"​。​​"被许可人"​​ 和 ​​"接收人"​​ 可以是个人或组织。

​​"修改"​​ 作品指以需要版权许可的方式从作品复制或改编全部或部分内容，而不是制作精确副本。 resulting work称为早期作品的 ​​"修改版本"​​ 或 ​​"基于"​​ 早期作品的作品。

​​"覆盖作品"​​ 指未修改的程序或基于程序的作品。

​​"传播"​​ 作品指对其进行任何没有许可会使您直接或间接根据适用版权法承担侵权责任的行为，除非在计算机上执行或修改私人副本。传播包括复制、分发（无论是否修改）、向公众提供，以及在某些国家/地区的其他活动。

​​"传递"​​ 作品指使其他方能够制作或接收副本的任何类型的传播。仅通过计算机网络与用户交互而没有传输副本，不构成传递。

交互式用户界面显示 ​​"适当的法律声明"​​ ，只要它包括一个方便且显著可见的功能，该功能（1）显示适当的版权声明，以及（2）告诉用户该作品没有保修（除非提供保修），被许可人可以根据本许可证传递作品，以及如何查看本许可证的副本。如果界面呈现用户命令或选项列表（例如菜单），列表中的突出项符合此标准。

1. 源代码
作品的 ​​"源代码"​​ 指对作品进行修改的首选形式。​​"目标代码"​​ 指作品的任何非源代码形式。

​​"标准接口"​​ 指要么是由公认标准机构定义的官方标准，要么是针对特定编程语言指定的接口中，在该语言开发人员中广泛使用的接口。

可执行作品的 ​​"系统库"​​ 包括除作品整体之外的任何内容，这些内容（a）以包装主要组件的正常形式包含，但不是该主要组件的一部分，以及（b）仅用于启用作品与该主要组件一起使用，或实现标准接口，该接口的实现以源代码形式向公众提供。在此上下文中，​​"主要组件"​​ 指特定操作系统（如果有）的主要基本组件（内核、窗口系统等），可执行作品在该系统上运行，或用于生成作品的编译器，或用于运行它的目标代码解释器。

目标代码形式作品的 ​​"对应源代码"​​ 指生成、安装和（对于可执行作品）运行目标代码以及修改作品所需的所有源代码，包括控制这些活动的脚本。但是，它不包括作品的系统库，或通用工具或通常可用的自由程序，这些程序在执行这些活动时未经修改使用但不是作品的一部分。例如，对应源代码包括与作品源文件关联的接口定义文件，以及作品专门要求使用的共享库和动态链接子程序的源代码，例如通过这些子程序与作品其他部分之间的密切数据通信或控制流。

对应源代码不需要包含用户可以从对应源代码的其他部分自动重新生成的任何内容。

源代码形式作品的对应源代码是同一作品。

2. 基本权限与原始开发者权利
根据本许可证授予的所有权利在程序的版权期限内授予，并且在满足所述条件时不可撤销。程序的原始开发人员保留对程序原始版本的专有所有权和商业权利，包括但不限于：

a) 在根据本许可证分发的同时，根据专有条款对原始作品进行商业许可的权利；

b) 对原始程序名称和品牌实施商标保护的权利；

c) 在所有衍生作品中获得作为原始开发者的署名的权利；

d) 为原始程序提供付费支持、保修和商业服务的权利。

3. 保护用户法律权利免受反规避法的影响
任何覆盖作品不得被视为根据任何适用法律履行1996年12月20日通过的WIPO版权条约第11条规定的义务的有效技术措施的一部分，或禁止或限制规避此类措施的类似法律。

当您传递覆盖作品时，您放弃任何法律权力，以禁止规避技术措施，只要这种规避是通过行使本许可证项下关于覆盖作品的权利实现的，并且您否认任何意图限制操作或修改作品作为对作品用户执行您或第三方禁止规避技术措施的法律权利的手段。

4. 传递逐字副本
您可以以收到的形式传递程序的源代码的逐字副本，以任何媒体，只要您在每份副本上显著且适当地发布适当的版权声明；保持所有声明本许可证和根据第7条添加的任何非许可条款适用于代码的声明完整；保持所有无保修的声明完整；并向所有接收人提供本许可证的副本以及程序。

您可以对传递的每份副本收取任何价格或不收费，并且您可以提供付费支持或保修保护。

5. 传递修改后的源代码版本
您可以基于程序传递作品，或从程序生成它的修改，以源代码形式根据第4条的条款，只要您也满足所有这些条件：

a) 作品必须带有显著声明，说明您修改了它，并给出相关日期。

b) 作品必须带有显著声明，说明它根据本许可证和根据第7条添加的任何条件发布。此要求修改了第4条中 ​​"保持所有声明完整"​​ 的要求。

c) 您必须将整个作品作为一个整体，根据本许可证许可给任何获得副本的人。因此，本许可证将连同任何适用的第7条附加条款一起适用于整个作品及其所有部分，无论它们如何包装。本许可证不允许以任何其他方式许可作品，但如果您单独收到此类许可，它不会使此类许可无效。

d) 如果作品具有交互式用户界面，每个必须显示适当的法律声明；但是，如果程序具有不显示适当法律声明的交互式界面，您的作品不需要使它们这样做。

覆盖作品与其他独立独立作品的编译，这些作品本质上不是覆盖作品的扩展，并且没有与它组合形成更大的程序，在存储或分发介质的卷上或中，如果编译及其产生的版权不用于限制编译用户超出单个作品允许的访问或法律权利，则称为 ​​"聚合"​​ 。在聚合中包含覆盖作品不会导致本许可证适用于聚合的其他部分。

6. 传递非源代码形式
您可以根据第4条和第5条的条款以目标代码形式传递覆盖作品，只要您也根据本许可证的条款以以下方式之一传递机器可读的对应源代码：

a) 在物理产品中或体现物理产品（包括物理分发介质）中传递目标代码，并附上固定在通常用于软件交换的耐用物理介质上的对应源代码。

b) 在物理产品中或体现物理产品（包括物理分发介质）中传递目标代码，并附上书面要约，有效期为至少三年且只要您提供该产品型号的备件或客户支持，向任何拥有目标代码的人提供（1）产品中受本许可证覆盖的所有软件的对应源代码的副本，在通常用于软件交换的耐用物理介质上，价格不超过您实际执行此源代码传递的合理成本，或（2）免费从网络服务器复制对应源代码的访问权限。

c) 传递目标代码的单个副本，并附上提供对应源代码的书面要约副本。此替代方案仅允许偶尔和非商业性地使用，并且仅当您收到带有此类要约的目标代码时，符合第6b小节。

d) 通过从指定地点提供访问权限（免费或收费）传递目标代码，并以相同方式通过同一地点免费提供对应源代码的等效访问权限。您不需要要求接收人随目标代码一起复制对应源代码。如果复制目标代码的地点是网络服务器，对应源代码可以在不同的服务器（由您或第三方操作）上，支持等效复制设施，只要您在目标代码旁边保持明确指示说明在哪里找到对应源代码。无论哪个服务器托管对应源代码，您仍有义务确保它在需要满足这些要求的时间内可用。

e) 使用点对点传输传递目标代码，只要您通知其他对等方在哪里根据第6d小节免费向公众提供作品的目标代码和对应源代码。

目标代码的可分离部分，其源代码从对应源代码中排除作为系统库，不需要包含在传递目标代码作品中。

​​"用户产品"​​ 是（1）​​"消费产品"​​ ，指通常用于个人、家庭或家庭目的的任何有形动产，或（2）设计或销售用于并入住宅的任何物品。在确定产品是否为消费产品时，有疑问的情况应有利于覆盖。对于特定用户收到的特定产品，​​"通常使用"​​ 指该类产品的典型或常见用途，无论特定用户的身份或特定用户实际使用或期望或预期使用产品的方式如何。无论产品是否有实质性的商业、工业或非消费用途，产品都是消费产品，除非此类用途代表产品的唯一重要使用模式。

用户产品的 ​​"安装信息"​​ 指从修改后的对应源代码在该用户产品中安装和执行覆盖作品的修改版本所需的任何方法、程序、授权密钥或其他信息。信息必须足以确保修改后的目标代码的持续功能不会仅仅因为进行了修改而受到阻止或干扰。

如果您在本节下在用户产品中、与用户产品一起或专门用于用户产品传递目标代码作品，并且传递作为交易的一部分发生，其中用户产品的占有和使用权永久或固定期限转移给接收人（无论交易如何描述），根据本节传递的对应源代码必须随附安装信息。但是，如果您或任何第三方保留在用户产品上安装修改后的目标代码的能力（例如，作品已安装在ROM中），则此要求不适用。

提供安装信息的要求不包括为已被接收人修改或安装的作品或已被修改或安装的用户产品继续提供支持服务、保修或更新的要求。当修改本身实质性和不利地影响网络操作或违反跨网络通信的规则和协议时，可能会拒绝访问网络。

根据本节传递的对应源代码和提供的安装信息必须采用公开记录的格式（并且以源代码形式向公众提供实现），并且必须不需要特殊密码或密钥来解压、读取或复制。

7. 附加条款 - 衍生作品要求
尽管有本许可证的任何其他规定，任何基于本程序的衍生作品必须根据相同的许可条款或自由软件基金会批准的兼容著佐权许可证分发。具体来说：

a) 所有修改、增强和衍生作品必须根据GNU AGPLv3或更高版本许可；

b) 任何合并、链接或使用本程序作为组件的软件必须根据GNU AGPLv3或兼容许可证发布；

c) 衍生作品的源代码必须根据相同条款免费向所有用户提供；

d) 仅当所有源代码保持开放并根据本许可证可访问时，才允许衍生作品的商业使用。

8. 原始开发者商业权利保护
原始开发人员保留以下专有权利：

a) 双重许可：根据开源（AGPL）和专有商业许可分发原始作品的权利；

b) 品牌保护：为商业目的使用原始程序名称、徽标和商标的专有权利；

c) 收益权：从原始作品的专有许可、商业支持和企业服务产生收益的专有权利；

d) 执行：对违反这些规定的未经授权商业使用采取法律行动的权利。

9. 原始开发者署名
所有衍生作品必须包括对原始开发人员的显著署名，形式如下：

​​"基于[程序名称]，由[原始开发者]开发，版权所有©[年份]。原始作品可在[网站URL]获取。商业许可可从[原始开发者]获取。"​​

10. 终止
除非本许可证明确允许，否则您不得传播或修改覆盖作品。任何以其他方式传播或修改它的尝试均无效，并将自动终止您在本许可证下的权利（包括根据第11条第三段授予的任何专利许可）。

但是，如果您停止所有违反本许可证的行为，则您从特定版权持有者处获得的许可将恢复（a）临时恢复，除非且直到版权持有者明确和最终终止您的许可，以及（b）永久恢复，如果版权持有者在停止后60天内未通过某种合理方式通知您违规行为。

此外，如果版权持有者通过某种合理方式通知您违规行为，这是您第一次从该版权持有者处收到违反本许可证的通知（对于任何作品），并且您在收到通知后30天内纠正违规行为，则您从特定版权持有者处获得的许可将永久恢复。

根据本节终止您的权利不会终止根据本许可证从您处收到副本或权利的各方的许可。如果您的权利已被终止且未永久恢复，您没有资格根据第10条获得相同材料的新许可。

11. 接受不是拥有副本的必要条件
您不需要接受本许可证即可接收或运行程序的副本。仅因使用点对点传输接收副本而发生的覆盖作品的辅助传播同样不需要接受。但是，除本许可证外，没有任何东西授予您传播或修改任何覆盖作品的许可。如果您不接受本许可证，这些行为会侵犯版权。因此，通过修改或传播覆盖作品，您表示接受本许可证以这样做。

12. 下游接收人的自动许可
每次您传递覆盖作品时，接收人自动从原始许可人处获得许可，以运行、修改和传播该作品，但须遵守本许可证。您不负责强制第三方遵守本许可证。

​​"实体交易"​​ 指转移组织控制权或一个组织的实质所有资产，或细分组织，或合并组织的交易。如果覆盖作品的传播源于实体交易，该交易的每一方收到作品副本的同时也获得该方利益前任根据前一段拥有的或可以给予的作品许可，以及从前任利益持有者处获得作品对应源代码的占有权，如果前任拥有它或可以通过合理努力获得它。

您不得对本许可证授予或确认的权利的行使施加任何进一步限制。例如，您不得对行使本许可证授予的权利收取许可费、版税或其他费用，并且您不得发起诉讼（包括诉讼中的交叉索赔或反诉），指控任何专利权利要求因制作、使用、销售、许诺销售或进口程序或其任何部分而受到侵犯。

13. 专利
​​"贡献者"​​ 是授权根据本许可证使用程序或程序所基于的作品的版权持有者。因此许可的作品称为贡献者的 ​​"贡献者版本"​。

贡献者的 ​​"必要专利权利要求"​​ 是贡献者拥有或控制的所有专利权利要求，无论是已获得还是此后获得，这些权利要求会以某种方式（本许可证允许）因制作、使用或销售其贡献者版本而受到侵犯，但不包括仅因对贡献者版本的进一步修改而受到侵犯的权利要求。就此定义而言，​​"控制"​​ 包括以符合本许可证要求的方式授予专利再许可的权利。

每个贡献者授予您非排他性、全球性、免版税的专利许可，根据贡献者的必要专利权利要求，以制作、使用、销售、许诺销售、进口以及以其他方式运行、修改和传播其贡献者版本的内容。

在以下三段中，​​"专利许可"​​ 指任何明示协议或承诺，无论如何称呼，不强制执行专利（例如专利实践的明示许可或不起诉专利侵权的契约）。​​"授予"​​ 此类专利许可给一方指作出此类协议或承诺不对该方强制执行专利。

如果您传递覆盖作品，明知依赖专利许可，并且作品的对应源代码无法通过公开可用的网络服务器或其他易于访问的方式供任何人免费复制并根据本许可证的条款获得，则您必须（1）使对应源代码如此可用，或（2）安排剥夺自己此特定作品的专利许可利益，或（3）以符合本许可证要求的方式安排将专利许可延伸至下游接收人。​​"明知依赖"​​ 指您实际知道，但专利许可，您在某个国家传递覆盖作品，或您的接收人在某个国家使用覆盖作品，会侵犯该国家一个或多个可识别专利，您有理由相信这些专利有效。

如果根据或连接单一交易或安排，您传递或通过采购传递传播覆盖作品，并授予专利许可给接收覆盖作品的一些方，授权他们使用、传播、修改或传递覆盖作品的特定副本，则您授予的专利许可自动延伸至覆盖作品的所有接收人和基于它的作品。

如果专利许可未包括在其覆盖范围内，禁止行使或以不行使本许可证特别授予的一项或多项权利为条件，则专利许可是 ​​"歧视性的"​。如果您是与从事软件分发的第三方达成安排的一方，根据该安排您根据传递作品的活动程度向第三方付款，并且根据该安排第三方授予从您处接收覆盖作品的任何一方歧视性专利许可（a）与您传递的覆盖作品副本（或从这些副本制作的副本）连接，或（b）主要针对和连接包含覆盖作品的特定产品或编译，除非您在该安排之前或该专利许可被授予之前（2007年3月28日之前）进入该安排。

本许可证中的任何内容不得解释为排除或限制任何默示许可或根据适用专利法可能对您可用的其他侵权抗辩。

14. 不放弃他人的自由
如果对您施加的条件（无论是通过法院命令、协议还是其他方式）与本许可证的条件相矛盾，它们不免除您遵守本许可证的条件。如果您无法传递覆盖作品以同时满足您在本许可证下的义务和任何其他相关义务，则结果您可能根本不能传递它。例如，如果您同意要求您从向您传递程序的人那里收取进一步传递的版税的条款，您满足这些条款和本许可证的唯一方式是完全避免传递程序。

15. 远程网络交互；与GNU通用公共许可证一起使用
尽管有本许可证的任何其他规定，如果您修改程序，您的修改版本必须显著向所有通过计算机网络远程与其交互的用户（如果您的版本支持此类交互）提供通过从网络服务器免费提供对应源代码的访问权限，通过促进软件复制的标准或惯用方式，接收您的版本的对应源代码的机会。此对应源代码应包括根据以下段落并入的GNU通用公共许可证第3版覆盖的任何作品的对应源代码。

尽管有本许可证的任何其他规定，您有权将任何覆盖作品与根据GNU通用公共许可证第3版许可的作品链接或组合成单个组合作品，并传递 resulting work。本许可证的条款将继续适用于作为覆盖作品的部分，但与其组合的作品将仍受GNU通用公共许可证第3版管辖。

16. 本许可证的修订版本
自由软件基金会可能不时发布GNU Affero通用公共许可证的修订和/或新版本。此类新版本在精神上与当前版本相似，但可能在细节上有所不同以解决新问题或关注。

每个版本都有一个区分版本号。如果程序指定GNU Affero通用公共许可证的某个编号版本 ​​"或任何更高版本"​​ 适用于它，您可以选择遵循该编号版本的条款和条件或自由软件基金会发布的任何更高版本。如果程序未指定GNU Affero通用公共许可证的版本号，您可以选择自由软件基金会曾经发布的任何版本。

如果程序指定代理可以决定GNU Affero通用公共许可证的哪些未来版本可以使用，该代理对版本接受的公开声明永久授权您为该程序选择该版本。

后来的许可证版本可能给您额外或不同的许可。但是，不会因您选择遵循 later version而对任何作者或版权持有者施加额外义务。

17. 免责声明
在适用法律允许的范围内，本程序不提供任何保修。除非另有书面说明，版权持有者和/或其他方按 ​​"原样"​​ 提供程序，不提供任何形式的明示或暗示保修，包括但不限于适销性和特定用途适用性的暗示保修。程序的质量和性能的 entire risk 由您承担。如果程序证明有缺陷，您承担所有必要的服务、维修或更正的费用。

18. 责任限制
除非适用法律要求或书面同意，否则任何版权持有者或任何其他以上述允许方式修改和/或传递程序的方均不对您承担损害赔偿责任，包括因使用或无法使用程序引起的任何一般、特殊、附带或后果性损害赔偿（包括但不限于数据丢失或数据不准确或您或第三方遭受的损失或程序无法与任何其他程序操作），即使此类持有者或其他方已被告知可能发生此类损害。

19. 第17和18条的解释
如果上述保修免责和责任限制不能根据其条款产生本地法律效力，审查法院应适用最接近放弃与程序相关的所有民事责任的本地法律，除非保修或责任承担伴随程序副本收费。

**GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE**
**Version 3, 19 November 2007 (Modified Version)**
**Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>**
**Additional Terms Copyright (C) 2025 [Fish_Blade]**
**Contact: QQ 2592741356**

**Important Note:** This modified version adds protections for the original developer's rights and requirements for open-sourcing derivative versions on top of the standard AGPLv3.

**Preamble**

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to happen. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.

An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

**0. Definitions.**
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

**1. Source Code.**
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, etc.) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

**2. Basic Permissions and Original Developer Rights.**
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. The original developer(s) of the Program retain exclusive ownership and commercial rights to the original version of the Program, including but not limited to:

a) The right to commercially license the original work under proprietary terms concurrently with distribution under this License;

b) The right to enforce trademark protection for the original program name and branding;

c) The right to receive attribution as the original developer in all derivative works;

d) The right to offer paid support, warranty, and commercial services for the original Program.

**3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.**
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

**4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.**
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

**5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.**
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

**6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.**
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of the following ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

**7. Additional Terms - Derivative Works Requirements.**
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, any derivative work based on this Program must be distributed under the same license terms or a compatible copyleft license approved by the Free Software Foundation. Specifically:

a) All modifications, enhancements, and derivative works must be licensed under the GNU AGPLv3 or a later version;

b) Any software that incorporates, links, or uses this Program as a component must be released under the GNU AGPLv3 or a compatible license;

c) The source code of derivative works must be made available to all users freely under the same terms;

d) Commercial use of derivative works is permitted only if all source code remains open and accessible under this License.

**8. Protection of Original Developer Commercial Rights.**
The original developer(s) retain the following exclusive rights:

a) Dual Licensing: The right to distribute the original work under both open source (AGPL) and proprietary commercial licenses;

b) Brand Protection: The exclusive right to use the original program name, logos, and trademarks for commercial purposes;

c) Revenue Rights: The exclusive right to generate revenue from proprietary licensing, commercial support, and enterprise services for the original work;

d) Enforcement: The right to take legal action against unauthorized commercial use that violates these provisions.

**9. Original Developer Attribution.**
All derivative works must include a prominent attribution to the original developer(s) in the following form:

"Based on [Program Name], developed by [Original Developer], Copyright © [Year]. The original work is available at [Website URL]. Commercial licensing is available from [Original Developer]."

**10. Termination.**
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation within 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

**11. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.**
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

**12. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.**
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

**13. Patents.**
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

**14. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.**
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

**15. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.**
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating software copy. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

**16. Revised Versions of this License.**
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

**17. Disclaimer of Warranty.**
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

**18. Limitation of Liability.**
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**19. Interpretation of Sections 17 and 18.**
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
